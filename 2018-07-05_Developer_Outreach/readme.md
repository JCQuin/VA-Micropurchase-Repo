# Microconsulting Work Statement – Developer Outreach

### NAICS Code: 541511/$27.5M

## Background 
VA is looking to expand the adoption of our API developer sandbox .  Simply making datasets and APIs available does not guarantee success.  Developers, Data Scientists and Researchers need to discover, try and ultimately decide to leverage VA data and APIs in the innovations they are building. This requires clear messaging that reaches Developers where they spend their time.  Documentation, demos, webinars, conferences, blog posts and more are used to effectively market to Developers.  

## The Play
As Product Manager I am seeking to meet developers where they are. I would like to better understand, with the intent to implement, best practices from the private and public sector in building documentation, demos, webinars, conferences, and blog posts to market our developer sandbox. We would like the primary research performed to gather best practices around: 

- Characteristics of effective developer outreach programs similar to our API Developer Sandbox, and who is successfully implementing them.

- Lessons learned from these organizations (both what is working and what isn't).
- Interviews with current developers in API Developer Sandbox and potential developers to understand their needs. List of current developers will be provided. 

- Recommendations for a developer outreach strategy VA should adopt for our API Developer Sandbox. 

## Deliverable
- Vendor shall make recommendations for an outreach strategy for API developer sandbox on best practices learned from the evaluated entities. Data shall be presented to VA in the most appropriate way, as defined in the proposal.

- Vendor shall provide all data/research learned from each entity to build the recommendation.

## Definition of Done
- Deliverable representative of the effort described in vendor's proposal 

- Deliverables shall be submitted to VA's GitHub Repo.  See VA Micropurchases workflow posted in VA's GitHub Repo.

## Time Box
VA anticipates a 2-week iteration to be sufficient. 2-week iteration shall start on an agreed upon date. 

#### Vendor may propose alternate time frame for VA's consideration based on the proposed approach.

## Disclaimer
In performance of this effort, the contractor shall not perform a function that requires access to a VA system or VA sensitive information (e.g., system administrator privileged access to a VA system, or contractor systems or processes that utilize VA sensitive information).  Additionally, the contractor shall not connect one or more contractor-owned IT devices to a VA internal trusted network.  Finally, this acquisition does not involve the storage, generating, transmitting, or exchanging of VA sensitive information.

## Evaluation

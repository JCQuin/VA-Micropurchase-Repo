# Microconsulting Work Statement – Scorecard MVP

NAICS 541511/$27.5M   

## The Play
Design, deploy, and document an online Application Programming Interface (API) scorecard minimum viable product (MVP). 

### Audience / Users:
- VA API Program Leadership
- VA OIT & Executive Leadership
- API teams (data entry)

### Purpose:
1. Monitor, measure, and report progress 
2. Enable project teams to signal leadership about risks early in order to mitigate, avoid, transfer or accept effectively
3. Tell a compelling story of API Platform program outcomes (targeted to an executive audience; this is not a detailed operational "dashboard") using a well-designed, simple interface.
4. This scorecard does not replace API team project management status reporting or other management reporting requirements. It is supplemental and will pull select metrics from those reports for the audience above.

### Background and Prior Work:
The API Management program is moving VA towards an API first digital enterprise. As VA develops APIs and makes them available both internally and externally, it needs a way of communicating its progress to leadership.  Previous VA projects have successfully used a Scorecard like the ones in the screenshots below, and the purpose of this work statement is to build a similar Scorecard for VA's API Platform.

A crucial component of a Scorecard is having phases and exit criteria between the phases, to determine where a product is in its lifecycle.  The below phases and exit criteria have been put together as a starting point and are expected to be iterated on during this engagement:

```
Phases of API Building

Discovery: 

- We know where in VA the is data coming from
- Have a document outlining what the API will include and how to use it
- Have talked to at least 2 customers to get feedback

Prototype:

- API is built in a test environment
- API is documented using OpenAPI Specification
- A consumer has successfully used the API in a test environment

Iterate:

- Incorporated feedback from the API consumer, as needed
- Load tested the API based on expected demand
- Made sure the correct operational and business metrics are being collected for this API

Go Live:

- Met with the consumer to view their application and usage of the API
- Ensured compliance with all VA privacy and security policies. 
- API is being used in production and usage monitored to ensure any errors are quickly remediated

Operations and Maintenance:

- Retired any previous APIs that need to be deprecated.
- Onboarded new API consumers
- Working with customers to understand their pain point or future desires from the API, then iterating based on their feedback and needs (likely starting this process over again). 
```

A few additional requirements for the scorecard are:
- Each team building APIs should be able to update the status of their product(s) on their own via GitHub.  
- After a team updates their status, it should be immediately visable when the Scorecard is refreshed by a user. 
- Each product should link to its API documentation, to allow users to get to the actual documentation from the Scorecard.  These URLs will be provided and creating the API documentation is not in scope for this project. 
- The Scorecard should follow the US Web Design System. It is up to the proposing team how to build/deploy the site; A free hosting service such as GitHub Pages may be easiest, but is not required.  Documentation must include how to build and keep the Scorecard updated. 

## Deliverables and Definition of Done

Deliverables shall be submitted to VA Github.  See VA Micropurchases workflow posted in VA Github.

1. Updated "Phases of API Building" and exit criteria for each phase are documented and agreed upon with VA stakeholders.
2. Mockups of a Scorecard, including documented at least one round of usability testing with VA stakeholders and the changes to be made based on that feedback. 
3. A publicly accessible Scorecard MVP, with the code in GitHub, to show the status of a few sample APIs and that meets the requirements agreed upon with Stakeholders and listed above. 
4. Documented instructions, including user onboarding and operational guidance for how the scorecard should be used and when a team building an API at VA should update the scorecard

## Time Box

VA anticipates:  2-3 weeks

- 1 week iteration to get up to speed on the previous Scorecard work done at VA, further defining the exit criteria, and designing the scorecard user experience. 
- 1-2 week iteration to build a working, publicly accessible MVP of the scorecard that can be edited by project teams individually. 

#### Vendors may propose alternate time frame for VA's consideration.

## Disclaimer
In performance of this effort, the contractor shall not perform a function that requires access to a VA system or VA sensitive information (e.g., system administrator privileged access to a VA system, or contractor systems or processes that utilize VA sensitive information).  Additionally, the contractor shall not connect one or more contractor-owned IT devices to a VA internal trusted network.  Finally, this acquisition does not involve the storage, generating, transmitting, or exchanging of VA sensitive information.

## Evaluation
-  Vendor shall describe how they will complete the deliverables and provide a fixed price for the entire work effort.  VA's micropurchase authority is $10,000 or less.
-  Government will determine which proposal is most beneficial to the Government.
-  Submissions shall be made to the following email addresses by COB July 16, 2018.
